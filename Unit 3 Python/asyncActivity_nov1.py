# For students learning Python please follow the instructions below
#Use what you've learned about data types and variables and create two variables that when added together will result in the value 245. Research the print() function on w3schools to output your result in the terminal.

#If you were asked to create a calendar app, which data type would you use to create the days of the week and which data type would you use for the date? Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

#What is the difference between the float and integer data types. Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

#Identify the the correct data type for each scenario:

#A comment section on a picture on instagram.
#A survey form that asks users if they have ever traveled to another country. Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.
#If there were three things you that feel could improve the class, what would those things be and why? Your answer can be formatted as a comment or a string.

# TASK 1 -

Num1 = 110
Num2 = 135

print("This equals") 
print(Num1 + Num2)

# TASK 2 -

# If I want to write the days of the week, I would use the string data type.
# Example:
days_of_week = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]

# If I want to write the dates of the week, I would use the integer data type.
# Example:
dates = [1, 14, 27]

# TASK 3 -
# Floats represent decimal numbers.
# Example:
float_example = 12.38483

# Integers represent whole numbers.
# Example:
integer_example = 1234

# TASK 4 -
# A comment section on a picture on Instagram.
# Data type: string
comment = "This picture is amazing!"

# A survey form that asks users if they have ever traveled to another country.
# Data type: boolean (True/False)
has_traveled = True
