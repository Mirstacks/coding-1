# 1. What does "string concatenation" mean?
string_concatenation = "String concatenation is when you combine two or more strings with the + (addition symbol) operator."

# Example of string concatenation
x = "This "
y = "is "
z = "Coding 1A"

print(x + y + z)

# 2. Please list and describe three rules for creating variable names.
variableRules = """
1. Variable names cannot start with a number.
2. Variable names should not contain spaces.
3. Variable names cannot use reserved keywords (like 'if', 'else', 'True', etc.).
"""

# 3. Define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them.

# - Camel case:
camel_case_description = "In camel case, the first word starts with a lowercase letter, and subsequent words start with uppercase letters."
camel_case_example = "thisIsCamelCase"

# - Snake case:
snake_case_description = "In snake case, words are separated by underscores and all letters are lowercase."
snake_case_example = "this_is_snake_case"

# - Pascal case:
pascal_case_description = "In Pascal case, each word starts with an uppercase letter, with no spaces or underscores."
pascal_case_example = "ThisIsPascalCase"

# 4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operator code snippets.

# ***Python Version***
a = 3  # The value of 'a' should be 3
b = a * 100
print(b)  # Output should be 300

# 5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables to get the requested result.

# ***Python Version***
# We need a logical operator that makes the result 'True'.
# Let's evaluate the conditions:
# x > 1 is True, z == 4 is True. So we can use the 'and' operator.

x = 10
y = 2
z = y * 2

logical_operator_result = x > 1 and z == 4  # Result: True
logical_operator_explanation = "We use 'and' because both conditions (x > 1 and z == 4) need to be True for the result to be True."

# Output the result and explanation
print(logical_operator_result)  # Output: True
print(logical_operator_explanation)
