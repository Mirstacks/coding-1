# 1. Create a function that will accept a word in the function parameter
# and return the word in reverse order.
# For example, the word 'pet' should return as 'tep', the word 'book'
# should return as 'koob', etc.
# HINT- There is a built-in function that you can use to accomplish this. 
# Please use W3 schools to research what function you'll need to use.
